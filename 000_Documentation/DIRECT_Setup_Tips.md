## Using Direct as a database project reference

If required, Direct can be installed in each database project as a reference, which means the Direct content will be installed in the hosting database when published.

In all cases, the post-processing script (reference data) needs to be run after the normal operations have been completed.

When setting up the reference, the 'same database' option should be used for database location. This will add the Direct content to the database.
